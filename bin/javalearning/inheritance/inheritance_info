Inheritance -
A class that is derived form another class is called subclass. The class form which the subclass is derived called superclass.
A subclass inherits all the members - fields, methods and nested classes from it's superclass. Constructore are not members, so
they are not inherited by subclass, but constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

When multiple classes share similar behaviour and properties.

Abstract -
Abstract class is a class that is declared 'abstract' - its may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract
class can't be instantiated but they can be subclassed.
When want hide some details / obj form outside of the world we use Abstract class.
abstract keyword can be used on class and methods.
abstract void moveTo(double X, double Y);

public abstract class GraphicObject{
    int count = 0;
    String name = "";
    abstract void draw();

    void display(){
        System.out.println("display out put");
    }
}

Interface -
interface  used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java. In other words,
interfaces primarily define abstract methods that other classes must implement.
Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
Interface can contains- methods signatures, default methods, static methods and nested types.
